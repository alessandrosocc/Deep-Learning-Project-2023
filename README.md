# A study of oversampling techniques using GAN and CycleGAN: an overview using a binary classifier

Final Project for the Deep Learning Course in 2022 at University of Cagliari.

## The Project
<center>
Does generating new samples using a generative model result in better performance than more classical augmentation models?
</center>

### The Goals
1. Generate new instances with two GANs, one generating dogs and one generating cats.
2. Use a CycleGAN to transform from one domain to another and have new examples from existing ones
3. Evaluate performance using original and generated data
4. Does it make sense to use models like GAN or CycleGAN to upsample data? How does performance vary?

### Steps
1. CycleGAN and GAN
2. Instance generation
3. Binary Classifier
4. Evaluation results
5. Conclusions and Delivery
